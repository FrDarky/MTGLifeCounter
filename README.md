# MTGLifeCounter
This is a Magic: The Gathering life counter application for Android. You can install it on any device running Android 4.0.3+.

## How to install
To install the app, you can download the source code (and read it if you want), and compile it on Android Studio [Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s)].  

You can also download the APK file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DKqkp0ba6_V1Zn68mwh83FvFLF3s-wcl/view?usp=sharing) (only the latest version will be available this way).  

NOTE: Make sure you can install unknown APKs on your device.

## How to use
Select the number of players of your game, then set up all the parameters. Once done, you will be sent to the life counter window.  

A short press on the left of your life counter will remove 1 life from you, and a short press on the right will give you 1 life. You can also do a long press instead to add/remove 5 life.

You also have access to a Coin flip and Dice roll (D4/D6/D20) with a designated button in the counter window.
